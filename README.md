Java Native Interface for C++
=============================

## Overview

JNIPP is just a C++ wrapper for the standard Java Native Interface (JNI). It
tries to take some of the long-winded annoyance out of integrating your Java
and C++ code.

## Requirements

To compile you will need:
 - A C++11 compatible compiler
 - An installation of the Java Development Kit (JDK)

To compile in Visual Studio, you will need your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
correctly set to the JDK installation directory.
